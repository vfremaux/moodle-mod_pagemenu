## Some tips of use

Menu are activities, so they are present into the backoffice activity bag and can be
reused on many pages.

when creating a new Menu, use the "Save and display" button to access to the menu content
configuration. this is a bit indirect access we might plan to change, but actually
the module is a straight upgrade without logic redesign.
